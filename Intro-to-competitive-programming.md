# What is Problem-Solving?
- It's a skill that can be developed over time.
- It's also a process (a set of steps) used to find solutions to challenges or obstacles.
- Problems can be of any nature (not just computer science-related).
- This skill can be acquired through learning and practice.

# What is Competitive Programming?
- It is a sport and intellectual activity where participants solve algorithmic problems under time constraints to determine who is the best at solving these problems efficiently.
- You can compete in many different formats (individually, in teams, in onsite competitions, or in online competitions).
- ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) is one of the largest and most prestigious programming competitions globally.
    - In ICPC, you compete as part of a team.
    - Your ranking depends on how many problems you solve, how quickly you solve them, and how accurate your solutions are.
